[00:00] Sub agents are one of the most powerful
[00:02] capabilities inside of Claw Code. And
[00:05] while a lot of people, a lot of creators
[00:07] talk about them or cover them, nobody is
[00:09] showing you how to build sub agents for
[00:12] writing operations or content creation
[00:14] inside of Cloud Code. So that's what I'm
[00:16] going to do today. I'm going to show you
[00:18] exactly how you can build a writing
[00:19] agent, how you can give it access to
[00:22] Claude skills to use, and how you can
[00:23] implement all of this in a larger
[00:26] writing system inside of Claude Code.
[00:28] Make sure to watch to the end of the
[00:30] video if you want to use all the exact
[00:31] resources I show you in this video. I'll
[00:33] tell you exactly how you can get them
[00:35] and put them into your own Claude code
[00:37] system. Before we get started into it,
[00:39] let's first just define what sub agents
[00:42] are. And to do that, we'll just look at
[00:43] Claude Codes documentation because they
[00:46] can define it better than any of us can.
[00:48] These are specialized AI sub aents in
[00:51] Cloud Code for task specific workflows
[00:54] and improved context management. custom
[00:56] sub aents in cloud code or special AI
[00:59] assistance that can be invoked to handle
[01:01] specific types of tasks. Now also
[01:03] important to note you don't even have to
[01:05] manually invoke these. If you have
[01:07] effective claude.md system prompts, if
[01:10] you have effective sub aent system
[01:12] prompts, then it will autonomously
[01:14] invoke the agents uh you know when it
[01:16] should. So that is another uh important
[01:19] thing to keep in mind. You can basically
[01:20] build out teams of these sub aents
[01:22] inside of your cloud code writing system
[01:24] and just run all these different writing
[01:26] operations, you know, with spinning up
[01:28] sub aents simultaneously, invoking them
[01:30] autonomously. So, there are a couple key
[01:33] benefits, you know, that we can run
[01:34] through really quick of sub agents. The
[01:36] first is context preservation. Each
[01:39] operates in its own context. This means
[01:41] it doesn't pollute the main
[01:42] conversation. It stays inside of that
[01:44] context. It also allows you to give
[01:46] specialized expertise to these sub
[01:48] agents so they can be fine-tuned with
[01:50] detailed instructions. Now, people
[01:53] create agents, you know, in various
[01:55] different ways. You know, a lot of what
[01:56] you're going to see out there is for
[01:57] development and coding work. But what I
[01:59] find best for writing operations in
[02:01] content creation is specifically using
[02:04] these sub agents as more or less like
[02:08] orchestrator agents for specific tasks.
[02:10] And then what you can do is load those
[02:12] sub aents up with specific claude skills
[02:15] that teach them how to carry out a
[02:17] specific task like writing a newsletter
[02:19] or a thought leadership article or maybe
[02:21] social media posts and the list can go
[02:23] on and on. So what you really want is
[02:25] these sub agents to be like
[02:27] orchestrators and then have a library of
[02:30] skills that they can invoke under them
[02:32] to carry out specific writing or content
[02:34] tasks. Also reusability once created you
[02:37] can use them across different projects.
[02:39] You could copy and paste these agents.
[02:41] You could sell them. You can use them in
[02:43] client systems. All of that is possible.
[02:45] And then we have flexible permissions.
[02:47] Each one can have different access to
[02:49] different tools, which we'll see when we
[02:51] actually create it. Now, to create this
[02:53] on the left side of my screen, you're
[02:55] going to see I have Claude code running
[02:56] in the terminal. I'm using cursor, but
[02:58] you could be using any, you know, code
[03:00] editor tool that that you want. You can
[03:02] also even use Claude's own desktop app,
[03:05] which now has Claude code in it. And you
[03:07] can even use a VS Code extension so you
[03:10] could see all of your different folders.
[03:12] And then my writing system here, we have
[03:14] a Claude file with an agents folder in a
[03:17] skills folder. We have a context file or
[03:19] context folder with my JSON context
[03:22] profiles which explain to Claude, you
[03:24] know, in JSON about my business about my
[03:27] ideal client profiles and how to write
[03:29] in my voice DNA. Then we have a
[03:32] knowledge folder which I use to hold uh
[03:34] you know all the different you know
[03:36] drafts and knowledge of my writing
[03:38] operations. And then we have our
[03:39] claude.md
[03:41] system prompt. Now you can have you know
[03:44] whatever system that you're running
[03:46] inside of claude code but you can also
[03:48] get this exact starting kit folder. I'm
[03:51] calling this like a claude code starter
[03:53] kit and you can watch my master class
[03:55] here that's also on YouTube and get
[03:56] access to this starter kit that you can
[03:58] just uh put right open up right in your
[04:01] own cursor or claude code and use it.
[04:03] But either way works. Today we're going
[04:05] to be just putting an agent inside of
[04:07] this system. Okay. So what we're going
[04:09] to do I'm going to open up the terminal
[04:11] here and to create an agent the first
[04:13] thing we need to do is put slash agent.
[04:16] And this is going to allow us to manage
[04:17] our agent configurations. You can see I
[04:20] already have one here that I created
[04:22] which we are going to delete really
[04:23] quick so that we could start fresh. But
[04:25] you're going to see all right agents. No
[04:27] agents found. Now we can create
[04:29] specialized sub agents. Now there are a
[04:32] couple built-in agents that you might
[04:33] not even have realized using cloud code.
[04:35] These are the ones that cloud code
[04:36] itself uses the ones that are like
[04:38] automatically inside here. There's like
[04:41] a general purpose one, a planning one,
[04:43] but today we're going to create specific
[04:45] ones for writing. So you're just going
[04:46] to hit enter here. And then the first
[04:48] thing you need to do is choose your
[04:49] location. You can either choose project
[04:51] meaning it's inside this project here or
[04:53] personal meaning it's on your system
[04:55] file or locally across all your
[04:57] projects. For writing operations, I like
[05:00] highly recommend using project specific
[05:02] agents because it's super easy just to
[05:04] take that file, copy it and paste it
[05:06] into any other projects and keep
[05:08] everything nice and clean. Especially if
[05:10] you're dealing, for example, maybe
[05:11] you're a ghostriter dealing with
[05:12] multiple clients or maybe you're running
[05:14] content for different startups or
[05:15] businesses or CEOs or whatever. I like
[05:18] to keep everything very siloed and
[05:20] protected from one another. So, I always
[05:22] use project here. The next we're going
[05:24] to have to do is choose our generation
[05:26] method. We can either generate with
[05:28] Claude or we can do a manual
[05:30] configuration. If you hit enter on
[05:32] generate with Claude, all you have to do
[05:34] is explain what kind of agent you want
[05:36] very simply. Be as detailed as possible,
[05:38] and Claude will create it for you. But
[05:40] for today, that's not what we're going
[05:41] to do. We're going to do a manual
[05:42] configuration because I highly recommend
[05:45] you just get good at writing these
[05:46] system prompts or finding other people
[05:47] like myself who provide them to you
[05:50] because these are highly specific for
[05:52] writing operations. These are the ones
[05:54] we use, I use in my daily uh, you know,
[05:57] writing businesses and content
[05:58] businesses. So, we're going to hit enter
[06:00] on manual configuration. And the first
[06:02] thing we need to do is enter a unique
[06:04] identifier. Today, what we're going to
[06:06] build is a newsletter uh writing agent.
[06:09] So, we're going to say a newsletter
[06:10] writer or we'll just say a newsletter
[06:13] agent. Click enter. Now, we need to
[06:15] write the system prompt. Now, there are
[06:18] many many techniques to go into writing
[06:19] system prompts. You can go learn those.
[06:22] You can study those. You can try it out
[06:23] yourself. I highly recommend always
[06:25] doing it. I don't write system prompts
[06:27] from scratch either. I work with Claude
[06:29] to write system prompts. Oftentimes what
[06:32] I'll do is also, you know, prior to this
[06:34] whole, you know, new Claude code and
[06:36] agents and all these different, you
[06:38] know, ways to run your writing
[06:40] operations. A lot of a lot of what we
[06:42] were using were prompts, right? Very
[06:43] detailed prompts beforehand. You can
[06:46] take those prompts and they are amazing
[06:48] starting points for building out into
[06:50] full agent system prompts. So, if you
[06:52] have prompts that you really like or
[06:54] that you've been using, just give that
[06:56] to Claude and ask it to help you turn
[06:58] that into an agent system prompt. Uh,
[07:00] and then go from there. Here, what we're
[07:02] going to do is I already have one. We're
[07:04] going to come here to my resources for
[07:07] my Subscribers.
[07:09] So, if you want this exact uh these
[07:12] exact agent system prompts and various
[07:14] other tools and skills, uh, check out my
[07:16] Substack. That's where you can get it.
[07:18] But we have the newsletter writer agent
[07:20] here and I have written out the entire
[07:22] system prompt. So we got the name like I
[07:24] said and now here is the system prompt.
[07:26] Claude code agents or sub aents all
[07:28] they're using is an MD you know a
[07:30] markdown file for the system prompt. So
[07:33] you can literally just copy this here.
[07:35] We have a newsletter writer agent. I'm
[07:37] going to copy all of this and then we'll
[07:39] go through it and I'll read you through
[07:41] some of it so you can see kind of how
[07:43] this works. Okay. So here on the left
[07:46] now we have the system prompt.
[07:48] Newsletter writer agent. You are a
[07:50] newsletter writing specialist. Your job
[07:52] is to coordinate the production of
[07:55] complete ready to publish newsletters.
[07:57] We then tell it that it's not writing
[07:59] from scratch. What it needs to do is
[08:01] load the user's context profiles from
[08:04] our system here on the left. It needs to
[08:06] gather necessary information from the
[08:08] user, find and use the appropriate
[08:10] writing skill. Like I told you, I build
[08:12] my agents so they invoke Claude skills.
[08:15] One of the most incredible things about
[08:17] Claude Code now is we have all these
[08:18] tools at our disposal. We have the sub
[08:20] agents, you know, or the cloud. MD at
[08:23] the top. We have sub agents underneath
[08:25] that. We have library of cloud skills
[08:27] underneath that. We have MCP servers.
[08:29] There's so much we can do for writing
[08:31] operations. Like nobody is doing this.
[08:33] So, if you're watching this video right
[08:34] now, if you're following me, if you're
[08:36] even attempting to start building this
[08:38] out, you are like in the 1% of the 1% of
[08:41] people using AI for writing operations
[08:44] because nobody else is really doing this
[08:46] right now. And then it's going to
[08:47] deliver a complete newsletter. We go
[08:50] through the step-by-step process. We
[08:52] tell it what to do and what not to do.
[08:54] All right. After we have the system
[08:56] prompts, we're just going to hit enter
[08:57] here. And now we're going to give it a
[08:59] description. This description is what
[09:01] your your main claude is going to read
[09:04] to know like when and when to use or
[09:07] invoke this agent. I actually have this
[09:09] written here too. So, let me just grab
[09:11] that also and copy it. We're going to
[09:14] tell it here in its description. We're
[09:17] going to say writes complete newsletters
[09:19] using context profiles and available
[09:21] skills. Use when a user wants to write
[09:24] Substack newsletters. You can change
[09:26] this to just uh you know thought
[09:27] leadership newsletters or just regular
[09:29] newsletters. Like I said, I have
[09:31] Substack. So I use this for myself for
[09:33] my own Substack uh content. And then
[09:35] we'll say mentions write a newsletter or
[09:38] draft a newsletter or needs long form
[09:40] educational content for their audience.
[09:42] So this just helps Claude understand
[09:43] when to use it. We're going to hit
[09:45] enter. Now we can select the tools we
[09:47] want to give it access to. We want to
[09:49] give it access to all the tools here.
[09:51] But you can even open this up and and
[09:53] take away or give certain access to
[09:54] certain tools. We're going to give it
[09:56] access to all tools. And now we need to
[09:58] select the model. If you do writing
[10:00] operations at scale, if you're serious
[10:02] about writing with AI in any level, if
[10:04] you're actually using it for
[10:05] professional work, highly recommend you
[10:07] sign up for Claude's uh or Anthropics
[10:10] Claude Max plan. Anywhere between a
[10:12] hundred I think to $200 a month, right?
[10:14] I use the $200 a month plan and I run
[10:17] Opus like multiple hours a day all day
[10:20] long. I never run into limits. So, if
[10:23] that's what you have, I recommend using
[10:24] Opus, uh, you know, as much as you can.
[10:27] Then, we're just going to choose a color
[10:29] here for the agent, whatever. Automatic
[10:31] color. And this is our new agent. We can
[10:33] now enter to save it. And there it is.
[10:36] We now have the agent, newsletter agent.
[10:38] And you're going to see that now in this
[10:40] dotcloud file, we have agents and we
[10:42] have our newsletter agent right here. So
[10:46] it's as simple as that. That's how we
[10:48] build the agent. But we're not done yet,
[10:50] right? Because yeah, the agents there,
[10:51] but it has no skills. This is like a
[10:53] agent with no skills. So we need to give
[10:55] it skills. And the skill we're going to
[10:57] give it, which it should eventually
[10:59] have, you know, many skills at its
[11:01] disposal to, you know, invoke. But what
[11:03] I want to give it is a thought
[11:05] leadership newsletter skill. All right.
[11:07] Also, I'm going to include this for
[11:09] subsec members. If you want, you can
[11:11] just download and use this exact claude
[11:13] skill. You could or you can go look for
[11:15] your own skills. You know, if you have
[11:17] them already, there's libraries out
[11:18] there. You could try to find them. But I
[11:20] really like this thought leadership
[11:21] newsletter skill. I use it for myself,
[11:23] for clients. Uh you can use it for, you
[11:26] know, writing thought leadership for
[11:27] executives, CEOs, startups, for
[11:29] yourself, for industry leaders. And what
[11:32] this newsletter skill does is it writes
[11:35] valuep packed thought leadership
[11:36] newsletters between 800 to 1500 words
[11:39] that educate, entertain, and position
[11:42] the writer as the go-to authority in
[11:44] their space. We're going to tell it when
[11:46] to activate this. When a user wants to
[11:49] write a newsletter weekly email, we're
[11:51] going to give it a core philosophy. Now,
[11:53] this is very detailed skill. My claude
[11:55] skills are highly detailed, multiple
[11:57] pages long. Uh so we have the four
[12:00] pillars of a killer newsletter. We tell
[12:02] it, you know, how to load our contact
[12:05] profiles. Kind of everything you see
[12:06] that I built here is very specific to
[12:08] our system. So this is not something
[12:10] other people are going to be copying and
[12:11] using. We have a very uh very unique
[12:14] approach here to building out writing
[12:16] operations inside of Cloud Code. We're
[12:18] going to tell it to load the context
[12:19] profiles, craft subject lines, uh what
[12:22] else? Write these hooks, greetings, all
[12:25] right, CTAs, all of that. It goes on and
[12:27] on and on, right? Not going to read
[12:29] through all of it. But once you have
[12:31] this skill, which you can literally
[12:33] download if you want the zip file here,
[12:35] and then we'll have the down here in the
[12:37] downloads, that will give us this folder
[12:39] here. And this is already in the correct
[12:43] format for Claude skills, which is the
[12:45] skill.md file in folder. And we just are
[12:48] going to drag that into our skills,
[12:51] which I already have there. So just
[12:52] replace it. And now you could see we
[12:55] have my agents folder with my newsletter
[12:57] agent and my skills folder with a couple
[13:00] skills that are already there and then
[13:01] this new thought leadership skill. So
[13:05] now we're officially done pretty much.
[13:07] Now we have our our writing sub agent
[13:10] inside of Claude Code for newsletters
[13:12] and we have a thought leadership
[13:14] newsletter skill that we're going to
[13:16] give that agent access to. So the next
[13:20] thing we do is just go to a regular
[13:21] chat. And now this would be up to you,
[13:23] you know, however it is you want to
[13:25] write these. Say you are working for a
[13:27] company or you are a ghostwriter for
[13:29] CEOs or executives and you need to write
[13:31] a thought leadership newsletter. You
[13:33] just need to provide your notes or
[13:35] transcripts or whatever serves as the
[13:37] basis of your idea for the newsletter.
[13:40] You're going to give it to Claude and
[13:41] tell it to write a thought leadership
[13:42] newsletter. Just to demonstrate this
[13:44] quickly, I'll go to a YouTube video that
[13:46] I released last week on adding 16
[13:49] professional skills to your Cloud Code
[13:51] setup. And I'm literally just going to
[13:53] paste this transcript in here. And I'm
[13:54] going to, you know, use voice dictation
[13:56] to tell Claude, um, here is a transcript
[13:59] on a YouTube video I did last week on
[14:01] adding professional skills to your
[14:03] Claude code setup. I want you to write a
[14:05] thought leadership newsletter, uh, based
[14:07] on this.
[14:09] And then we're going to paste it. Paste
[14:11] the transcript. Now when Claude starts
[14:13] spinning up this process here, the first
[14:15] thing it's going to do is read our
[14:17] context profiles here, our JSON context
[14:20] profiles. This is going to help it
[14:21] understand our business or voice our
[14:23] ideal client profiles. Uh so we want to
[14:26] do that that is written into our claude
[14:29] file or claude.md that is written into
[14:31] our agents. Our skills all very heavily
[14:34] rely on these context profiles. After
[14:36] that, it's going to launch the
[14:38] newsletter agent to write this thought
[14:39] leadership newsletter based on my
[14:42] YouTube video. So, that's going to take
[14:43] a few seconds. I'll let that run
[14:45] through. It's going to invoke the
[14:47] thought leadership skill and uh and then
[14:50] we'll see what the final output is. Now,
[14:53] when you see this here, you could see
[14:54] that this is the actual agent. Where did
[14:57] it go? Here. This is the actual agent
[14:59] that's spinning up and working here. And
[15:01] we can even run this now in the
[15:03] background. If you were to hit control
[15:05] uh B, you could run this in the
[15:07] background as you're doing other things
[15:08] inside of Cloud Code, which is awesome.
[15:10] You can run up multiple agents. You can
[15:12] work on something else while it's
[15:13] running. Uh but, you know, that's that's
[15:16] for a future another video after you
[15:18] start using uh agents. So, let's let
[15:20] that run for a few seconds and then get
[15:22] back to it. All right. So, it literally
[15:24] took like less than a minute and it's
[15:26] already done. We can see here that it
[15:29] finished. The newsletter agent finished
[15:31] and it gave us our thought leadership
[15:33] newsletter based on the YouTube video.
[15:35] It gives us our subject line options. We
[15:38] have Claude Code has a secret upgrade
[15:40] most people don't know about. I just
[15:42] discovered hidden skills inside of Cloud
[15:43] Code. The Claude feature that turns your
[15:45] writing system into a content machine.
[15:47] This is all based off of the skill I
[15:48] gave it. We have the newsletter,
[15:51] you know, this the thought leadership
[15:53] newsletter completely written out in my
[15:55] voice using my voice DNA targeted at my
[15:57] ICP. uh you know at my ideal client
[16:01] profile with my business context with
[16:03] best practices for writing subject lines
[16:06] and and and headings and titles with the
[16:09] CTA that we told it. So we have this
[16:12] very detailed thought leadership
[16:13] newsletter. Uh and then we have a couple
[16:15] notes here at the bottom. We sign off
[16:18] here. Talk soon Alex. Then we have some
[16:20] notes from Claude itself uh about what
[16:23] it did here. So you can see like the
[16:24] newsletter uses your voice DNA uh speaks
[16:27] to your ICP's pain points and transform
[16:29] transforms it into a scannable thought
[16:31] leadership piece with clear CTAs. So
[16:35] that is it. That is how you build out an
[16:38] incredible writing operation inside of
[16:40] Claude code. That is how you build a
[16:41] newsletter writing sub agent with you
[16:44] know Claude skills that it can use to
[16:46] write different types of newsletters.
[16:48] What I'm showing you here is incredibly
[16:50] valuable. Uh this is just the beginning
[16:53] of what you can do. Imagine all the
[16:55] different sub aents you could build, all
[16:57] the different cloud skills that you
[16:59] could give them access to. And you start
[17:01] to really see what the future of, you
[17:03] know, writing operations inside of
[17:05] Claude code or AI really looks like. You
[17:08] see how much power one individual can
[17:10] have with all these different sub aents
[17:13] running underneath them, which is
[17:14] exactly what I do. I don't have a single
[17:16] employee. I don't have a single person
[17:18] writing for me. I don't have nothing. I
[17:20] run all of these writing operations and
[17:22] agents myself in claude code across
[17:25] different businesses. I have number two
[17:27] newsletter rising on substack technology
[17:30] that I use these sub agents to help me
[17:32] with. I have client work. I ghostrite
[17:35] for CEOs. I run content for startups all
[17:38] by myself using these sub agents. So
[17:40] definitely check this out. If you're not
[17:42] doing it, you need to be doing it. And
[17:44] if you haven't joined my substack yet,
[17:46] definitely consider doing that because
[17:48] here you'll get access to all these
[17:50] resources that you see in my videos.
[17:51] Quad code starting kits, quad code sub
[17:54] agent skills. So check that out.
