1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,520
Sub agents are one of the most powerful

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,439
capabilities inside of Claw Code. And

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,839
while a lot of people, a lot of creators

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,800
talk about them or cover them, nobody is

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,879
showing you how to build sub agents for

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,800
writing operations or content creation

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,320
inside of Cloud Code. So that's what I'm

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
going to do today. I'm going to show you

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
exactly how you can build a writing

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,840
agent, how you can give it access to

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
Claude skills to use, and how you can

12
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,719
implement all of this in a larger

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
writing system inside of Claude Code.

14
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,759
Make sure to watch to the end of the

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,759
video if you want to use all the exact

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
resources I show you in this video. I'll

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,359
tell you exactly how you can get them

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
and put them into your own Claude code

19
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,238
system. Before we get started into it,

20
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,920
let's first just define what sub agents

21
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,558
are. And to do that, we'll just look at

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,960
Claude Codes documentation because they

23
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:51,519
can define it better than any of us can.

24
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,160
These are specialized AI sub aents in

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,719
Cloud Code for task specific workflows

26
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,198
and improved context management. custom

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,439
sub aents in cloud code or special AI

28
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,759
assistance that can be invoked to handle

29
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,280
specific types of tasks. Now also

30
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,359
important to note you don't even have to

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,400
manually invoke these. If you have

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,239
effective claude.md system prompts, if

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
you have effective sub aent system

34
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,640
prompts, then it will autonomously

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,118
invoke the agents uh you know when it

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,640
should. So that is another uh important

37
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,640
thing to keep in mind. You can basically

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
build out teams of these sub aents

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,239
inside of your cloud code writing system

40
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
and just run all these different writing

41
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,879
operations, you know, with spinning up

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,040
sub aents simultaneously, invoking them

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,560
autonomously. So, there are a couple key

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,560
benefits, you know, that we can run

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,040
through really quick of sub agents. The

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,200
first is context preservation. Each

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,320
operates in its own context. This means

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,478
it doesn't pollute the main

49
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,478
conversation. It stays inside of that

50
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:48,560
context. It also allows you to give

51
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,719
specialized expertise to these sub

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,519
agents so they can be fine-tuned with

53
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,359
detailed instructions. Now, people

54
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,798
create agents, you know, in various

55
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,920
different ways. You know, a lot of what

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,920
you're going to see out there is for

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
development and coding work. But what I

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
find best for writing operations in

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,159
content creation is specifically using

60
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:10,639
these sub agents as more or less like

61
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,560
orchestrator agents for specific tasks.

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,359
And then what you can do is load those

63
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,840
sub aents up with specific claude skills

64
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680
that teach them how to carry out a

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
specific task like writing a newsletter

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
or a thought leadership article or maybe

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
social media posts and the list can go

68
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,119
on and on. So what you really want is

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,000
these sub agents to be like

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,159
orchestrators and then have a library of

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,800
skills that they can invoke under them

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,919
to carry out specific writing or content

73
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,840
tasks. Also reusability once created you

74
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,679
can use them across different projects.

75
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
You could copy and paste these agents.

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
You could sell them. You can use them in

77
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,759
client systems. All of that is possible.

78
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,919
And then we have flexible permissions.

79
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,598
Each one can have different access to

80
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,759
different tools, which we'll see when we

81
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:55,199
actually create it. Now, to create this

82
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,719
on the left side of my screen, you're

83
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,799
going to see I have Claude code running

84
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,719
in the terminal. I'm using cursor, but

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,879
you could be using any, you know, code

86
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,039
editor tool that that you want. You can

87
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,759
also even use Claude's own desktop app,

88
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,158
which now has Claude code in it. And you

89
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,399
can even use a VS Code extension so you

90
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,399
could see all of your different folders.

91
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,120
And then my writing system here, we have

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,599
a Claude file with an agents folder in a

93
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,158
skills folder. We have a context file or

94
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,560
context folder with my JSON context

95
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,519
profiles which explain to Claude, you

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,680
know, in JSON about my business about my

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,000
ideal client profiles and how to write

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,480
in my voice DNA. Then we have a

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,479
knowledge folder which I use to hold uh

100
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,000
you know all the different you know

101
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,518
drafts and knowledge of my writing

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
operations. And then we have our

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
claude.md

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,158
system prompt. Now you can have you know

105
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
whatever system that you're running

106
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,519
inside of claude code but you can also

107
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,039
get this exact starting kit folder. I'm

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,039
calling this like a claude code starter

109
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,639
kit and you can watch my master class

110
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,878
here that's also on YouTube and get

111
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,199
access to this starter kit that you can

112
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,438
just uh put right open up right in your

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,280
own cursor or claude code and use it.

114
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,598
But either way works. Today we're going

115
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,759
to be just putting an agent inside of

116
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,280
this system. Okay. So what we're going

117
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,438
to do I'm going to open up the terminal

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,000
here and to create an agent the first

119
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,918
thing we need to do is put slash agent.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,079
And this is going to allow us to manage

121
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,240
our agent configurations. You can see I

122
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,840
already have one here that I created

123
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,918
which we are going to delete really

124
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,519
quick so that we could start fresh. But

125
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,758
you're going to see all right agents. No

126
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,079
agents found. Now we can create

127
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,520
specialized sub agents. Now there are a

128
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,359
couple built-in agents that you might

129
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,560
not even have realized using cloud code.

130
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,960
These are the ones that cloud code

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,040
itself uses the ones that are like

132
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,519
automatically inside here. There's like

133
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,040
a general purpose one, a planning one,

134
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,399
but today we're going to create specific

135
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,080
ones for writing. So you're just going

136
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,198
to hit enter here. And then the first

137
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,359
thing you need to do is choose your

138
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,680
location. You can either choose project

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,439
meaning it's inside this project here or

140
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,199
personal meaning it's on your system

141
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,079
file or locally across all your

142
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,400
projects. For writing operations, I like

143
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,240
highly recommend using project specific

144
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,159
agents because it's super easy just to

145
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,240
take that file, copy it and paste it

146
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
into any other projects and keep

147
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,280
everything nice and clean. Especially if

148
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
you're dealing, for example, maybe

149
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,399
you're a ghostriter dealing with

150
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,918
multiple clients or maybe you're running

151
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,239
content for different startups or

152
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,478
businesses or CEOs or whatever. I like

153
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,478
to keep everything very siloed and

154
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,800
protected from one another. So, I always

155
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,560
use project here. The next we're going

156
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,720
to have to do is choose our generation

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,560
method. We can either generate with

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,479
Claude or we can do a manual

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,399
configuration. If you hit enter on

160
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,240
generate with Claude, all you have to do

161
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,159
is explain what kind of agent you want

162
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,079
very simply. Be as detailed as possible,

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,280
and Claude will create it for you. But

164
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,800
for today, that's not what we're going

165
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,038
to do. We're going to do a manual

166
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
configuration because I highly recommend

167
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:47,918
you just get good at writing these

168
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,159
system prompts or finding other people

169
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,319
like myself who provide them to you

170
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,320
because these are highly specific for

171
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,279
writing operations. These are the ones

172
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,959
we use, I use in my daily uh, you know,

173
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,399
writing businesses and content

174
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,478
businesses. So, we're going to hit enter

175
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,399
on manual configuration. And the first

176
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,478
thing we need to do is enter a unique

177
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,599
identifier. Today, what we're going to

178
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,719
build is a newsletter uh writing agent.

179
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,120
So, we're going to say a newsletter

180
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,919
writer or we'll just say a newsletter

181
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,079
agent. Click enter. Now, we need to

182
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,758
write the system prompt. Now, there are

183
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,240
many many techniques to go into writing

184
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,919
system prompts. You can go learn those.

185
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
You can study those. You can try it out

186
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:27,758
yourself. I highly recommend always

187
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,758
doing it. I don't write system prompts

188
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,000
from scratch either. I work with Claude

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,560
to write system prompts. Oftentimes what

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,959
I'll do is also, you know, prior to this

191
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,879
whole, you know, new Claude code and

192
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,159
agents and all these different, you

193
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,319
know, ways to run your writing

194
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,919
operations. A lot of a lot of what we

195
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
were using were prompts, right? Very

196
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:48,318
detailed prompts beforehand. You can

197
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,318
take those prompts and they are amazing

198
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,639
starting points for building out into

199
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
full agent system prompts. So, if you

200
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
have prompts that you really like or

201
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,000
that you've been using, just give that

202
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,400
to Claude and ask it to help you turn

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,879
that into an agent system prompt. Uh,

204
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,959
and then go from there. Here, what we're

205
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,839
going to do is I already have one. We're

206
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,598
going to come here to my resources for

207
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,079
my Subscribers.

208
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:14,560
So, if you want this exact uh these

209
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,800
exact agent system prompts and various

210
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,639
other tools and skills, uh, check out my

211
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
Substack. That's where you can get it.

212
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,000
But we have the newsletter writer agent

213
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,159
here and I have written out the entire

214
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,879
system prompt. So we got the name like I

215
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,960
said and now here is the system prompt.

216
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,959
Claude code agents or sub aents all

217
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,359
they're using is an MD you know a

218
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,120
markdown file for the system prompt. So

219
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
you can literally just copy this here.

220
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,439
We have a newsletter writer agent. I'm

221
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,360
going to copy all of this and then we'll

222
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,598
go through it and I'll read you through

223
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,479
some of it so you can see kind of how

224
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:48,560
this works. Okay. So here on the left

225
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,560
now we have the system prompt.

226
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,800
Newsletter writer agent. You are a

227
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,199
newsletter writing specialist. Your job

228
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,680
is to coordinate the production of

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
complete ready to publish newsletters.

230
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,759
We then tell it that it's not writing

231
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,000
from scratch. What it needs to do is

232
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,479
load the user's context profiles from

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,240
our system here on the left. It needs to

234
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,560
gather necessary information from the

235
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,639
user, find and use the appropriate

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,598
writing skill. Like I told you, I build

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,038
my agents so they invoke Claude skills.

238
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,560
One of the most incredible things about

239
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,719
Claude Code now is we have all these

240
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
tools at our disposal. We have the sub

241
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,039
agents, you know, or the cloud. MD at

242
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,038
the top. We have sub agents underneath

243
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,759
that. We have library of cloud skills

244
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,519
underneath that. We have MCP servers.

245
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
There's so much we can do for writing

246
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,799
operations. Like nobody is doing this.

247
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,240
So, if you're watching this video right

248
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,158
now, if you're following me, if you're

249
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,680
even attempting to start building this

250
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:44,240
out, you are like in the 1% of the 1% of

251
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,239
people using AI for writing operations

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,919
because nobody else is really doing this

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,080
right now. And then it's going to

254
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,079
deliver a complete newsletter. We go

255
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,480
through the step-by-step process. We

256
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,399
tell it what to do and what not to do.

257
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,680
All right. After we have the system

258
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,440
prompts, we're just going to hit enter

259
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,679
here. And now we're going to give it a

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,320
description. This description is what

261
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:07,039
your your main claude is going to read

262
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,680
to know like when and when to use or

263
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,599
invoke this agent. I actually have this

264
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,559
written here too. So, let me just grab

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,360
that also and copy it. We're going to

266
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,599
tell it here in its description. We're

267
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,600
going to say writes complete newsletters

268
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,080
using context profiles and available

269
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,080
skills. Use when a user wants to write

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
Substack newsletters. You can change

271
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
this to just uh you know thought

272
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
leadership newsletters or just regular

273
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,278
newsletters. Like I said, I have

274
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,919
Substack. So I use this for myself for

275
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,080
my own Substack uh content. And then

276
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,240
we'll say mentions write a newsletter or

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,160
draft a newsletter or needs long form

278
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
educational content for their audience.

279
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,360
So this just helps Claude understand

280
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,679
when to use it. We're going to hit

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,278
enter. Now we can select the tools we

282
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,039
want to give it access to. We want to

283
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,120
give it access to all the tools here.

284
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,958
But you can even open this up and and

285
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
take away or give certain access to

286
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,479
certain tools. We're going to give it

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
access to all tools. And now we need to

288
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,080
select the model. If you do writing

289
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,159
operations at scale, if you're serious

290
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,600
about writing with AI in any level, if

291
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,519
you're actually using it for

292
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,240
professional work, highly recommend you

293
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,320
sign up for Claude's uh or Anthropics

294
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,959
Claude Max plan. Anywhere between a

295
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,839
hundred I think to $200 a month, right?

296
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,559
I use the $200 a month plan and I run

297
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,120
Opus like multiple hours a day all day

298
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,879
long. I never run into limits. So, if

299
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,839
that's what you have, I recommend using

300
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,120
Opus, uh, you know, as much as you can.

301
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
Then, we're just going to choose a color

302
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,600
here for the agent, whatever. Automatic

303
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,640
color. And this is our new agent. We can

304
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,879
now enter to save it. And there it is.

305
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,639
We now have the agent, newsletter agent.

306
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,879
And you're going to see that now in this

307
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,240
dotcloud file, we have agents and we

308
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,078
have our newsletter agent right here. So

309
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,000
it's as simple as that. That's how we

310
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,599
build the agent. But we're not done yet,

311
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
right? Because yeah, the agents there,

312
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
but it has no skills. This is like a

313
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
agent with no skills. So we need to give

314
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
it skills. And the skill we're going to

315
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
give it, which it should eventually

316
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,680
have, you know, many skills at its

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,040
disposal to, you know, invoke. But what

318
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,599
I want to give it is a thought

319
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,360
leadership newsletter skill. All right.

320
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,120
Also, I'm going to include this for

321
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,278
subsec members. If you want, you can

322
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
just download and use this exact claude

323
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,278
skill. You could or you can go look for

324
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,639
your own skills. You know, if you have

325
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,559
them already, there's libraries out

326
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,838
there. You could try to find them. But I

327
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,759
really like this thought leadership

328
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,000
newsletter skill. I use it for myself,

329
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,360
for clients. Uh you can use it for, you

330
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,919
know, writing thought leadership for

331
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,560
executives, CEOs, startups, for

332
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,439
yourself, for industry leaders. And what

333
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,879
this newsletter skill does is it writes

334
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,920
valuep packed thought leadership

335
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,159
newsletters between 800 to 1500 words

336
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,639
that educate, entertain, and position

337
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,559
the writer as the go-to authority in

338
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,278
their space. We're going to tell it when

339
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,439
to activate this. When a user wants to

340
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,120
write a newsletter weekly email, we're

341
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
going to give it a core philosophy. Now,

342
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,278
this is very detailed skill. My claude

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,240
skills are highly detailed, multiple

344
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,399
pages long. Uh so we have the four

345
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,120
pillars of a killer newsletter. We tell

346
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,879
it, you know, how to load our contact

347
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
profiles. Kind of everything you see

348
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,240
that I built here is very specific to

349
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,599
our system. So this is not something

350
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,399
other people are going to be copying and

351
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
using. We have a very uh very unique

352
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
approach here to building out writing

353
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,679
operations inside of Cloud Code. We're

354
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,958
going to tell it to load the context

355
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:25,439
profiles, craft subject lines, uh what

356
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,759
else? Write these hooks, greetings, all

357
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,279
right, CTAs, all of that. It goes on and

358
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,519
on and on, right? Not going to read

359
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,278
through all of it. But once you have

360
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,679
this skill, which you can literally

361
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,600
download if you want the zip file here,

362
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,599
and then we'll have the down here in the

363
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,040
downloads, that will give us this folder

364
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,440
here. And this is already in the correct

365
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,879
format for Claude skills, which is the

366
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,040
skill.md file in folder. And we just are

367
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,879
going to drag that into our skills,

368
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,838
which I already have there. So just

369
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,519
replace it. And now you could see we

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,240
have my agents folder with my newsletter

371
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,839
agent and my skills folder with a couple

372
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,200
skills that are already there and then

373
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,279
this new thought leadership skill. So

374
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,000
now we're officially done pretty much.

375
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,720
Now we have our our writing sub agent

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,879
inside of Claude Code for newsletters

377
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
and we have a thought leadership

378
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,000
newsletter skill that we're going to

379
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,599
give that agent access to. So the next

380
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,759
thing we do is just go to a regular

381
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,120
chat. And now this would be up to you,

382
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,439
you know, however it is you want to

383
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,679
write these. Say you are working for a

384
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,680
company or you are a ghostwriter for

385
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,439
CEOs or executives and you need to write

386
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,919
a thought leadership newsletter. You

387
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,760
just need to provide your notes or

388
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,159
transcripts or whatever serves as the

389
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,519
basis of your idea for the newsletter.

390
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,958
You're going to give it to Claude and

391
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,879
tell it to write a thought leadership

392
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,799
newsletter. Just to demonstrate this

393
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,838
quickly, I'll go to a YouTube video that

394
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,599
I released last week on adding 16

395
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,200
professional skills to your Cloud Code

396
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
setup. And I'm literally just going to

397
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,399
paste this transcript in here. And I'm

398
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,519
going to, you know, use voice dictation

399
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,600
to tell Claude, um, here is a transcript

400
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,360
on a YouTube video I did last week on

401
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,600
adding professional skills to your

402
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,759
Claude code setup. I want you to write a

403
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,440
thought leadership newsletter, uh, based

404
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,039
on this.

405
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
And then we're going to paste it. Paste

406
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,360
the transcript. Now when Claude starts

407
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,679
spinning up this process here, the first

408
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,079
thing it's going to do is read our

409
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,679
context profiles here, our JSON context

410
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,679
profiles. This is going to help it

411
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,559
understand our business or voice our

412
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,039
ideal client profiles. Uh so we want to

413
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,599
do that that is written into our claude

414
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,399
file or claude.md that is written into

415
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,879
our agents. Our skills all very heavily

416
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,078
rely on these context profiles. After

417
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,679
that, it's going to launch the

418
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,078
newsletter agent to write this thought

419
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,439
leadership newsletter based on my

420
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,198
YouTube video. So, that's going to take

421
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
a few seconds. I'll let that run

422
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,399
through. It's going to invoke the

423
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:53,120
thought leadership skill and uh and then

424
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,639
we'll see what the final output is. Now,

425
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,198
when you see this here, you could see

426
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,360
that this is the actual agent. Where did

427
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,519
it go? Here. This is the actual agent

428
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,278
that's spinning up and working here. And

429
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,519
we can even run this now in the

430
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,198
background. If you were to hit control

431
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,959
uh B, you could run this in the

432
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,799
background as you're doing other things

433
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,479
inside of Cloud Code, which is awesome.

434
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,838
You can run up multiple agents. You can

435
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,000
work on something else while it's

436
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,079
running. Uh but, you know, that's that's

437
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,240
for a future another video after you

438
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:22,000
start using uh agents. So, let's let

439
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,320
that run for a few seconds and then get

440
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,159
back to it. All right. So, it literally

441
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,278
took like less than a minute and it's

442
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:31,759
already done. We can see here that it

443
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,519
finished. The newsletter agent finished

444
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,360
and it gave us our thought leadership

445
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,480
newsletter based on the YouTube video.

446
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,320
It gives us our subject line options. We

447
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,079
have Claude Code has a secret upgrade

448
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,920
most people don't know about. I just

449
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,599
discovered hidden skills inside of Cloud

450
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,039
Code. The Claude feature that turns your

451
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,879
writing system into a content machine.

452
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,679
This is all based off of the skill I

453
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,120
gave it. We have the newsletter,

454
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,359
you know, this the thought leadership

455
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,679
newsletter completely written out in my

456
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,039
voice using my voice DNA targeted at my

457
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:03,919
ICP. uh you know at my ideal client

458
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:06,319
profile with my business context with

459
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:09,599
best practices for writing subject lines

460
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,079
and and and headings and titles with the

461
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
CTA that we told it. So we have this

462
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,838
very detailed thought leadership

463
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,160
newsletter. Uh and then we have a couple

464
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,160
notes here at the bottom. We sign off

465
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,039
here. Talk soon Alex. Then we have some

466
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,559
notes from Claude itself uh about what

467
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,278
it did here. So you can see like the

468
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,919
newsletter uses your voice DNA uh speaks

469
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,519
to your ICP's pain points and transform

470
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:35,360
transforms it into a scannable thought

471
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,000
leadership piece with clear CTAs. So

472
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
that is it. That is how you build out an

473
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,919
incredible writing operation inside of

474
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,958
Claude code. That is how you build a

475
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,879
newsletter writing sub agent with you

476
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,719
know Claude skills that it can use to

477
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,720
write different types of newsletters.

478
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,440
What I'm showing you here is incredibly

479
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,759
valuable. Uh this is just the beginning

480
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,600
of what you can do. Imagine all the

481
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,120
different sub aents you could build, all

482
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,440
the different cloud skills that you

483
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,679
could give them access to. And you start

484
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,600
to really see what the future of, you

485
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,639
know, writing operations inside of

486
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,879
Claude code or AI really looks like. You

487
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,038
see how much power one individual can

488
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
have with all these different sub aents

489
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,480
running underneath them, which is

490
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,079
exactly what I do. I don't have a single

491
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,240
employee. I don't have a single person

492
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,240
writing for me. I don't have nothing. I

493
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,279
run all of these writing operations and

494
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,599
agents myself in claude code across

495
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,399
different businesses. I have number two

496
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,719
newsletter rising on substack technology

497
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,519
that I use these sub agents to help me

498
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,480
with. I have client work. I ghostrite

499
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,639
for CEOs. I run content for startups all

500
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,880
by myself using these sub agents. So

501
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
definitely check this out. If you're not

502
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,559
doing it, you need to be doing it. And

503
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
if you haven't joined my substack yet,

504
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,000
definitely consider doing that because

505
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,919
here you'll get access to all these

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,319
resources that you see in my videos.

507
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,720
Quad code starting kits, quad code sub

508
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,720
agent skills. So check that out.
