I want you to use the Context7 plugin to study the newest langchain and langgraph documentation
and create a guide on how one to use the langchain to 
- communicate and interact with the various LLMs
- build a simple chat application 
- use the chain capabilities of the langchain
- use templates and runnables 
I want you to remain focused on the langchain avoiding to involve the langgraph's more sophisticated capabilities.

I want you to study the Google API documentation and create a detailed guide on how to create
python and npm/typescript scripts to get access to my Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides

get the summary, or search for specific info in such documents,
how can I move and reorganize them, in drive folders,
how can i examine how has access to them, how can i share them with others, and how can i revoke their access from them

 I plan to use these guidelines to create a claude code skill to help me examine and manage my gdrive and the documents stored in it

- delete documents from the stores
- replace documents in the stores
- keep track of the stores created and keep track of the documents uploaded to the stores
I want you to use the "110 - Gemini-File-Search-Tool-Guide.md" document to get all the necessary instructions.
The document's sample scripts have been implemented into the "110 - Gemini File Search Tool" folder.
The API key needed for the Gemini File Search Tool is stored in the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.


I want you to study the Google API documentation and create a detailed guide on how to create
python and npm/typescript scripts to use the Nano Bananas API to build images, diagrams, schematic representations, infographics, and other types of visualizations. 
I plan to use these guidelines to create skills to enable claude code to use the Nano Bananas API to build visual artefacts based on documents and content. 
You can use the Context7 plugin to collect the necessary information to create the guide. In case you face any issues, please let me know.


Is it feasible to create a prebuilt TypeScript tool within the manage-gemini-file-search skill to support the user's request to list the available stores, thereby avoiding code duplication each time?

I want you to use the create-agent-skills skill to create a skill to enable claude code to use the Nano Banana API for the following tasks:
- create images using the Nano Banana API
- edit images using the Nano Banana API
- generate diagrams, schemas, and other types of visualizations using the Nano Banana API
I want you to use the "111 - Nano-Banana-API-Guide.md" document to get all the necessary instructions.
The document's sample scripts have been implemented into the "111 - Nano Banana API" folder.
The API key needed for the Nano Banana API is stored in the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable.
I want you to use only typescript to implement the skills. I want you to create prebuilt tools for each of the tasks mentioned above, to avoid code duplication each time I try to do something.



I want you to study the langchain documentation, to find how I could send images in various formats like pdf, png, jpg, etc to a model, and assuming that the image is a document, to ask the model to extract specific data (e.g. a specific value, or date, etc)
I want you also to search the internet to find which are the suggested models for this kind of processing, and apart of the standard models, you instructions to be focused on these specialized models as well.
I want you to collect all this information in a document, and add a dedicated section on what are the prerequisites (like API_KEY, registration etc) for each case or approach.
I want you to enrich the document with examples as sample code.




I want you to implement a tool to transcribe YouTube videos using the Youtube-caption-extractor library following the instructions from the "103 - YouTube-Transcription-Guide-ts.md" document. 
I want you to put the code in the dedicated folder under the "103 - YouTube Transcription" folder.
I want you to test it using the https://youtu.be/0hgyHOLIFxw?si=QislrW_I_UISBXqt video.

If you detect any discrepancy I want you to report it, instead of trying to fix it. 


I want you to explore the GitHub API to find if there are instructions on how I could explore and manage code repositories programaticaly. I want you to explore the maximum extend of operations a developer or a technical leader is performing against the github repositories.
You can use the Context7 plugin to search the documentation.
Then I want you to collect all the information needed together with examples in the "120 - GitHub-Management-Guide-ts.md" document.
All the examples must be in Typescript.



I want you to explore the Google API to find if there are instructions on how I could monitor YouTube channels for recently published videos.
