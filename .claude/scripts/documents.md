I want you to use the Context7 plugin to study the newest langchain and langgraph documentation
and create a guide on how one to use the langchain to 
- communicate and interact with the various LLMs
- build a simple chat application 
- use the chain capabilities of the langchain
- use templates and runnables 
I want you to remain focused on the langchain avoiding to involve the langgraph's more sophisticated capabilities. 



I want you to use the Context7 plugin to study the newest DSPy documentation
and create a guide on the following 
- what is this framework about and how one can use it 
- the benefits, and the limitations
- a couple of indicative examples using it 
I want you to create a begginers guide rather than a reference or an advanced guide.
